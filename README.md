# Flutter-Basics
This is a repository where I post basic flutter projects and implemented challenges that I complete while learning flutter from different mentors.
I learnt amazing executions of different widgets while learning them , every App has a different file here .
I am sorry if you find it a little confusing . I hope you find them useful .
