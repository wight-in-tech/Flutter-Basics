# challengefirst

A new Flutter project(second project) where I started everything from scarth and practiced what 
I learned earlier. Just like our older I am rich App here we are displaying an image . I was too 
much lazy to find an image of a stone and also didnt feel okay to make something like that.
So, here I am uploading a picture from my gallery.
