# I am Rich App 
This was the first and most basics app I built with flutter. It belongs to the 
course I took on Udemy by Angela hu. This is an App that just displays a photo of a ruby
just to show people that they are virtually rich , this doesn't make so much sense but its good 
to practice these. 

## things that I learned here:
* Basics of Material Design
* What a Scaffold is 
* AppBar
* Adding Assets
* Generating App-icons and adjusting them for our App
* How to run App on a physical device
